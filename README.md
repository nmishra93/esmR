# esmR
This R program facilitates seamless interaction with the Evolutionary Scale Modeling (ESM) Atlas API to retrieve predicted structures and sequences within R 


# To implement
- FASTA parsing.
    - added (2023-12-21)
- MGnify ID parsing from the esm atlas JSON file.
    - added (2023-12-21)
- Separate directory creation for PDB and FASTA files.
- Error handling for invalid ESM IDs.
- Project??
- lapply instead of for loop?

# Example
ESM structure search performed with pdb 3EGM chain A.
